{"name":"Enviswitch","body":"The basic idea behind it is that you can set up a website folder which will then have multiple site environments\r\nadded to it. These environments should, ideally, be for the same domain with a different sub domain\r\ne.g. www.testsite.com, test.testsite.com, dev.testsite.com, etc...\r\n\r\nWhen installed open up the options page of the extension and you should see a box with EnviSwitch Root in it,\r\nright click on that to get a menu to add a new site folder.\r\n\r\nWhen adding a new site folder you want to set up the name and site address, the site address would be the\r\ndomain name only e.g. testsite.com not http://www.testsite.com or www.testsite.com.\r\n\r\nOnce you have the site folder set up you can then add sites to it by right clicking on the folder and selecting add.\r\nYou will get a prompt similar to the other which will take the site name and the url for the site. In the site url you\r\nwant to enter the full url for the site e.g. http://www.testsite.com or http://test.testsite.com.\r\n\r\nYou can also edit and delete sites and site folders by right clicking on them and selecting the appropriate option.\r\n\r\nVersion  Changes\r\n0.3.0    Added ability to add sites from the omnibox.\r\n         Added ability to ignore sites.\r\n0.2.1    Small bug fix.\r\n0.2.0    Environments based on sub-domains or ports depending on whether you are using an IP address or not.\r\n         Any sites already entered will need to be edited to work with this version.\r\n","tagline":"Google Chrome Plugin allowing you to change between website subdomains.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
